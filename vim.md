I reinitialized the repository by using the git init command first, then I added the updated file to the repository by using the git add ListExamples.java command and pressing enter. Subsequently, I utilised the git commit -m programme and hit enter to commit the modifications together with a note indicating "Fixed testMerge2". Finally, I pushed the modifications to the main branch by using the git push origin main command and pressing enter. Hit the following keys: git <space> init <enter> git <space> add <space> <enter> ListExamples.java commit space on git Enter -m space "Fixed testMerge2" and then git, push, origin, and main.
