# Lab Report 5

## Part 1

I'm attempting to develop a method that accepts an array as input and outputs a new array that has each and every entry from the input array. Instead of printing the first element in the original array, my code skips the first one and begins printing each subsequent element from the second one. I think there might be a problem with my for loop.Â This is a code screenshot.
